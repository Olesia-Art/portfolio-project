              Yogurt is a food produced by bacterial fermentation of milk.[2]
              The bacteria used to make yogurt are known as yogurt cultures.
              Fermentation of sugars in the milk by these bacteria produces
              lactic acid, which acts on milk protein to give yogurt its texture
              and characteristic tart flavor. Cow's milk is the milk most
              commonly used to make yogurt. Milk from water buffalo, goats,
              ewes, mares, camels, and yaks are also used to produce yogurt. The
              milk used may be homogenized or not. It may be pasteurized or raw.
              Each type of milk produces substantially different results.
